# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## File Uploader API - Scalable Backend Service

### Document Information
- **Product Name**: File Uploader API
- **Version**: 2.0.0
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Author**: Roderick Moise
- **Status**: Production Ready

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
A lightweight, infinitely scalable file upload API service that enables direct client-to-cloud uploads using presigned URLs, eliminating traditional server bottlenecks and supporting unlimited file sizes.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Traditional file upload architectures route files through backend servers (Client → Server → Storage), creating:
- Server bandwidth bottlenecks
- Memory limitations for large files
- Increased infrastructure costs
- Poor scalability for high-volume applications
- Inability to handle files over 100MB efficiently

### 1.3 Solution Overview
This API implements direct client-to-S3 uploads where the backend only generates secure, time-limited URLs. Files bypass the server entirely, enabling unlimited scale and file sizes.

1. Request presigned URL (POST /api/upload/presigned-url)
2. API generates URL using AWS SDK
3. Client uploads directly to S3 using presigned URL
```

### 4.2 Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Justification |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Runtime | Node.js 18+ | Modern JS features, performance |
| Framework | Express.js | Minimal, widely adopted |
| Cloud Storage | AWS S3 | Industry standard, reliable |
| SDK | AWS SDK v3 | Modular, tree-shakeable |
| URL Generation | @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner | Official AWS presigning |

### 4.3 Data Flow

1. **URL Request Phase**
   - Client sends filename, content type, size
   - API validates metadata
   - API generates unique S3 key
   - API creates presigned PUT URL
   - Returns URL + metadata to client

2. **Upload Phase**
   - Client PUTs file directly to S3
   - No server involvement
   - S3 handles all data transfer

3. **Confirmation Phase** (Optional)
   - Client notifies API of completion
   - API can trigger workflows
   - Useful for tracking/analytics

### 4.4 API Specification

#### Generate Presigned URL
```http
POST /api/upload/presigned-url
Content-Type: application/json

Request:
{
  "filename": "document.pdf",
  "contentType": "application/pdf", 
  "fileSize": 5242880
}

Response (200):
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "presignedUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/...",
    "fileUrl": "https://bucket.s3.../uploads/123-uuid.pdf",
    "s3Key": "uploads/123-uuid.pdf",
    "fileId": "uuid-v4",
    "expiresIn": 3600
  }
}

Response (400):
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "File size exceeds 10MB limit"
}
```

## 5. Security & Compliance

### 5.1 Security Measures
- **Presigned URL Expiration**: 1-hour validity
- **URL Scope**: Limited to specific file and operation
- **Input Validation**: File size, type, name sanitization

- **HTTPS Only**: Encrypted data transmission
- **No Data Retention**: Server never stores file content

### 5.2 Compliance Considerations
- **GDPR**: No PII stored on servers
- **HIPAA**: Compatible (files go directly to encrypted S3)
- **SOC 2**: Audit trails via S3 access logs
